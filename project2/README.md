# Project 2: Four in a Row Game

This assignment introduces you to a React web programming environment

Take the tic-tac-toe example from class and extend it so that it functions as a Connect Four game.

## Game logic:

* The board must be 6 rows and 7 columns.
* Clicking in any column "drops" a user's tile into that column, if an open spot exists. If not open spot exists, the user's click does nothing.
* Detects a 4 in a row situation horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Displays the winner. Users can't keep playing if there is a winner.
* Detects if the game ends in a tie.
* Properly switches to the other player when a tile placement completes.

## Other details:

Tiles should be colored. No animation necessary.

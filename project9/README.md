# Project 9: Portfolio

### [Repository Can Be Found Here](https://github.com/JessiStrattonWeber/jessistrattonweber.github.io)

## Overall purpose: 
Create an online portfolio, with a later goal to finish it for potential employers or graduate schools.

Use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for your portfolio. .

Examples of portfolios can be found [here:](https://github.com/emmabostian/)

## Requirements:

* Work in your group to assist each other in portfolios. Often generating a master template assists greatly.
* Post screenshots of all projects completed in this course.  
* Avoid posting homework assignments from other courses as these can be considered copyright violation or reveal answer keys for reusable assignments.

### A general rule of thumb to follow for each project:

* Your overall goal is to impress a job recruiter within 30 to 60 seconds.
* A recruiter should be able to clone your report and get all code in one git clone. I recommend putting code projects into separate clearly labeled directories. Do not worry about ensuring the code easily runs or is hosted. Just get all code in one place. Doing this requires copying your projects files and folders into your portfolio project.
Each project should have about a full page of description for the project  (This full page description can be within a web page in the portfolio, or in the GitHub's readme.)
    - At least two screenshots.
    - Strongly consider using an animated gif or a video of the project in motion (not required).
    - An explanation of the technologies used, including one or more technical challenges you solved.
    - An explanation of your particular contributions.
    - A link to that code's folder in the repo.

If you do not like GitHub pages, you can consider using another front end of your own website to highlight. But all code must still be in a single public repo.

If you would like to follow a standard template, then have the main repo's readme.md file give the overview. It should briefly describes yourself, then organizes the page into short sections for projects. Use proper formatting syntaxLinks to an external site.. Each section has a short description of that project's purpose, code, and work you contributed. Also each section has animated gifs showing the project in action. Each section also links to the GitHub project's folder that contains the code for that project. With this readme.md in place, a potential employer could simply visit your page, then the readme.md would render, and the person can scroll down and quickly see code in action and could click on the code to see more. (The employer could also still git clone the entire repository to view it locally.)

## Options and limitations for this assignment:

* No requirement to also post your own resume.
* No requirement to post projects completed in other courses. (Again, don't post homework assignments, professors don't want to see their homework solutions posted online. But open ended projects can work if you choose.)
* No requirement to post personal projects completed outside of classes.
* No requirement to post videos of the project in action. (Animated usually gifs are sufficient, but narrated videos take much more work.)
* If you want to use something else besides GitHub for your portfolio, you can do so. Just remember the person must be able to clone all code from class projects in a single git clone invocation.
